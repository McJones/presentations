^ We think a lot about documentation, as one of the main things we do is write documentation, often in the form of books.

---

### [fit] The Situation

^ We present a lot of programmer training workshops, particularly teaching rapidly changing technologies such as game development, and Apple's developer environment –– Swift, previously Objective-C, and APIs like Cocoa and CocoaTouch for Mac and iPhone development.

---

### [fit] Code + Docs + Notes?!

^ In the last 2 years of teaching these classes, particularly with Swift, Apple's new language, we've noticed that those in the class trying to learn the language have particularly enjoyed one component of the way Apple's frameworks and languages work: Swift Playgrounds.

### [fit] People Get Lost

^ People mess up where they are when moving between the code and documentation.

---

> I find the documentation and my own notes living alongside the code to be incredibly handy. It means I don't get lost learning this language and APIs.
-- feedback Swift training in Melbourne, May 2016

### [fit] Code + Docs + Notes

^ The more we explored these Interactive Environments –– today we're calling them Interactive Documentation Environments –– the more we thought they were particularly amazing for certain types of technical educational material, teaching, and distributing some types of documentation.

## Code + Docs + Notes

- Swift Playgrounds

- IPython Notebooks

- ... which are now Jupyter Notebooks

- ...and a few others

---

---
## Swift 

- Introduced 2 years ago by Apple
- Currently at version 2.2
- Made open source in December 2015[^1]
- Apache License 2.0
- Currently supports OS X and Linux
- Windows support on the way

[^1]: For more information on the Swift project, check out their website: http://swift.org/

---

## Swift Playgrounds

- an interactive Swift coding environment
- each statement is evaluated and displayed
- designed for prototyping, experimentation, and learning
- can be paginated
- supports Markdown  

---

## IPython Notebooks

- Interactive Python coding environment
- works pretty much the same as Swift Playgrounds
- designed for academic and scientific documentation
- Supports text, equations, and graphs

---

![inline](images/jupyter.png)

---

## Project Jupyter

- Successor to IPython
- Started in 2014
- Supports multiple languages
- Otherwise the same as IPython Notebooks

---

## Markup in Playgrounds

![inline](images/markdown_playground.png)

^ Comment on Erik's opinions on markdown.

---

## Swift Playgrounds

^ Let's take a more detailed look at Swift playgrounds, our favourite example of this sort of thing!

---

## [fit] Live Demo!

^ DEMO: Newton's Cradle

^ This is a quick run-through of 

---

## Project Jupyter Notebook

put a movie in of this!

---

## Project Jupyter in the Browser

---

## Strengths

- Code and Docs __literally__ together
- ... also notes by the person reading the docs	
- Can change things on the fly
- Mixed Media

---

## Notes and Code and Documentation

- you can mix your notes in with the pre-written documentation


---

## Live Demo!

![filtered](images/bird.jpg)

^ DEMO: Creating new documentation for something (maths)

---

## Weaknesses 

- Kinda crashy...
- Limited language/framework support
- Doesn't hook into docs tools
- Only really works for narratives
- Not every language/platform/thing

---

## What's next?

- Boffin's will fix the tech
- Be easier to add in new languages & projects
- This will replace/become books & articles
- Better support for non-narrative documentation
- More integration with video and screensharing

---

## Where to learn more...

- On a Mac? Download Xcode from the App Store
    - Then play in Playgrounds.
- On something else? Download IPython
	- Then ??
